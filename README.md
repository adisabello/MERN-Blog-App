# MERN-Blog-App
#Coming up with the concept
The website I chose to create is a developers blog, where they come
together to discuss and troubleshoot issues they come across in their
professions.
Members can register and share ideas by posting questions and respond
to other people's posts by commenting.
A member can manage their own posts, by deleting the posts or deleting
specific comments
Anyone can access the website to view the information, but in order to 
post or comment they need to be logged in.

#Creating Server
I started with creating the database for the user, posts and comments
using mongoDB with mongoose framework
I created the server with express and Apollo server. I designed all the
necessary queries and mutations and tested them before moving on to the 
frontend

#Creating a Service Worker, PWA
I created a react app using the PWA template. 
I then moved on to making my pages to make use of the Apollo server
using the APollo provider.
I applied the necessary styles to make the application look modern
and did the final testing before submitting the project
